# 👩‍💼 Employee Directory — React Frontend

A responsive and user-friendly Employee Directory application built using **React**, with functionalities to **add**, **edit**, **delete**, **search**, and **filter** employees. This project was created as part of a frontend UI assignment to demonstrate clean, modular, and modern front-end development without using external APIs.

💭 Reflection
✅ Challenges Faced:
Structuring the state management for dynamic form updates (edit vs add).

Building responsive UI from scratch without a CSS framework.

Validating forms and ensuring smooth user feedback with only client-side logic.

🔧 What I'd Improve with More Time:
Add localStorage to persist employee data between sessions.

Implement full filtering/sorting with dropdown logic.

Add pagination or infinite scrolling for large datasets.

Use TypeScript for better type safety and scalability.

Write unit tests using React Testing Library and Jest.
